# This is the final project where data was taken on music to try and predict what songs become hits. At the end of the project, changes to the logic of the project became necessary but was too late to pivot and have a project. This folder is for what was submitted.

# Repo used for SPE 486 Final Project about Spotify data and predicting 'hits'

# Files are from final project presentation and paper and not to be edited without reason

# Original data is not to be touched

# Cleaned data is not to be touched unless model updates require it
